# Spacing

Spacing is a fundamental aspect of design that helps create a sense of balance and harmony in a layout. It refers to the amount of space between elements, such as margins, padding, and line height. Proper spacing can enhance readability, improve user experience, and create a visually appealing design.

Our spacing system is built on a modular scale, ensuring consistent and harmonious spacing across the design. It combines principles from Utopia and [BBC GEL guidelines](https://www.bbc.com/gel/features/spacing-units) to achieve a balance between flexibility and structure.
